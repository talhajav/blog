I graduated this year from university with an engineering degree (and iron ring- it's a Canadian thing) and entered the industry to work on autonomous vehicles. Despite the tough circumstances of 2020- it's also come with many blessings. 

I've been on my [PEY](http://engineeringcareers.utoronto.ca/internships-overview/pey/) for the past year and with some of that free time I started to rekindle my love for reading. I used to read a lot as a kid and loved it, but for some reason I stopped reading books for recreation and only read those that were required for school.
<br>
<br>
I still have a long way to go until I finish my reading list. The rate at which I'm adding books to it is greater than the rate at which I finish books on it, so it looks like I'll never be finished.
<br>
<br>
I've been reading a lot of blogs over the past year and thought I'd finally join in with my own. A lot of my favorite blogs are from people in the VC world, entrepreneurs or designers/engineers who enjoy sharing their knowledge. A lot of what they blog about are things I enjoy learning.
<br>
<br>
I'm an engineering student so I don't get to hone my communication skills as much as I would like. Communication of my ideas, and frankly in general has never been my forte. Hopefully with this blog, I'll be able to get better at writing.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to writing more posts, and learning more about webdev as I maintain/update this blog.
