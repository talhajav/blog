Hi. I'm a recent graduate from the ME program the [University of Toronto](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/undergraduate-program/mechanical-engineering/) who loves building things. I enjoy drinking various permutations of coffee. I am currently working on autonomous vehicles in the Bay Area.
