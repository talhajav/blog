Hi!
My name is Talha Javed and I'm a mechatronics engineer with a variety of interests ranging from technology to coffee. If you were to take the dot product of them, the result would be zero.

Some other things about me:
- I recently graduated from the ME program the [University of Toronto](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/undergraduate-program/mechanical-engineering/)
- I am currently working on autonomous(ground) vehicles in the Bay Area but worked on medical devices and autonomous(air) vehicles in the past in Toronto.
